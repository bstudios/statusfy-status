Migration has meant pageload times have dropped to around 12% of previous levels. For example loading a large asset list has dropped from 4.5s to 521 ms.</p>\n</div></div></div>\n<div class=\"update-block\">\n          <div class=\"update-block-date\">2021-03-07T10:00:00.000Z</div>\n          <div class=\"update-block-content\">\n            <div class=\"update-block-title\">Identified</div>\n            <div class=\"update-block-body\">\n<p>Cause has been traced to increased latency on the interconnect between the production website servers and the database.
